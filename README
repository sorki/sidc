Installation and setup notes for sidd-1.0, 24th Nov 2008.
---------------------------------------------------------

Installation steps
------------------
1/ Obtain and install FFTW3 from www.fftw.org

2/ Compile the sidd source with

   ./configure
   make

3/ Edit sidd.conf to suit your requirements.  Select an output policy from the
   three available.  

4/ Start sidd in verbose foreground mode with the command

   ./sidd -vvf

   The program will output peak and rms readings in the range 0.0 to 1.0
   Adjust your mixer gain settings to leave a little headroom on the peak
   reading.

5/ Plot the utility spectrum file

6/ Check the data file columns are the ones you want.

7/ Set your PC clock and activate your favourite time synchronisation 
   software.  Make sure it slews the clock rather than stepping the time.

8/ Restart sidd in background with

  ./sidd -v

9/ After a period of time, plot some of the data from the output file.

10/ After a midnight crossing, make sure sidd has switched to the next
    output file.

Command line options
--------------------
There are just a few command line options - most controls are
in the config file. 

 -v    Be a little more verbose with log messages. 
       Use several -v for more detail.

 -f    Run in foreground.  By default, sidd detaches from the process
       group and terminal and becomes a daemon.  In foreground mode,
       log messages are duplicated to stderr.

 -c config_file   Run with a specified config file.  By default, sidd looks
                  for a file sidd.conf in the current directory.

Miscellaneous notes
-------------------
*
sidd will set the soundcard to the nearest available sample rate to that
specified in sidd.conf

*
24 bit soundcards may return data in 32 bit words.  Try setting 'bits 24'
and if sidd reports the mode unavailable, use 'bits 32'.

*
Make sure you have enough disk space.   The example sidd.conf with 8 bands
generates files of about 100Mbytes per day, which compress down to about 
30Mbytes.    Arrange scripts for plotting.  Arrange scripts for compressing
and archiving files that are a few days old.

*
If your PC is set to autoboot after a power outage, you might want to put
a startup command for sidd into /etc/rc.d/rc.local or similar - but make
sure the RTC and mixer setting commands are done first.
